    <h1 id="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</h1>

<p>This agreement is updated as of May 5, 2016, replacing all previous versions in their entirety.</p>

<p>HOLLER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE: This Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (an entity or person) (“You”) and Holler, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to herein as Holler, “us”, and “our”) that governs Your limited, non-exclusive, terminable right to use the Holler.com website and related services (“Site”), the servers the Site is stored on, and the computer files stored on that server. By clicking on the “Accept” button, or otherwise using the Site or any of the services, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT CLICK ACCEPT AND CANNOT USE THE SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

<p>Holler may amend this Agreement from time-to-time. All amended terms automatically take effect on the sooner of the day You use the Service or 10 days after they are initially posted on the Site. Your use of the Site following the effective date of any modifications to this agreement will constitute Your acceptance of the Agreement, as modified. You agree that adequate notice constitutes an announcement made on the Site concerning any modifications to the Terms of Use, and that no further notice is required.</p>

<p>You may only use the Site and services provided by the Site given the fact that You are not less than 13 years of age and You are legally permitted to enter into a binding agreement.</p>

<h2 id="services-offered-by-holler">Services Offered by Holler</h2>
<p>Holler provides users the ability to (i) make or receive voice calls from a ten-digit phone number and (ii) send and receive SMS/MMS messages to groups or individuals by using ten-digit phone numbers provided by Holler through Twilio (the “Holler Phone Number”).</p>

<p>These services can be used from or accessed anywhere in the world and from any other device that can access the Internet. Additionally, Holler offers other services associated with providing voice calling and SMS/MMS messaging capability; such services are listed on Holler’s pricing page found at: https://www.holler.com/pricing, (all service offerings are cumulatively referred to herein as the “Service”).</p>

<p>To use the Service You must have valid phone service, cellular or otherwise, which is based in the United States or Canada. A segment of the voice offerings provided by the Services initiates a call to the personal phone number listed on Your account and, only after You accept that call, will it connect to the Holler contact You dialed. Although these calls use Your third-party phone service, they will appear on Your Holler contact’s phone as coming from the Holler Number. Alternatively, the Services can work completely over an internet connection using voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) or your wireless plan’s data connection. Because Services may rely on Your internet service or data connection, Services may be subject to the limits of Your internet service or data connection.</p>

<p>You cannot use the Service to place certain calls, which include but are not limited to international, 1-900 or other toll calls, 911 and certain other N11 services (211, 311, 511), area code 500, 700, and 710 calls, 10-10-XXX dial-around calls, or international operator or directory assistance calls. Because the Service may rely on Your third-party service, any limitations in that service will also limit the manner in which You can use the Service.</p>

<h3 id="spam-policy">1. Spam Policy</h3>
<p>Spamming is not permitted on Holler.</p>

<p>“Spam” is any message, the principal purpose of which is to promote the sale of goods or services, including the content of a website which is operated on a commercial basis, or to promote a political purpose or objective, to the recipient, and consisting of advertising material for the lease, sale, rental, gift, offer, or other disposition of any realty, goods, services, or extension of credit, or advertising material for political purposes.</p>

<p>Holler maintains a zero tolerance policy regarding the delivery of Spam or unwanted commercial messages using the Service. Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, You will not send, cause to be sent, or facilitate the sending of Spam using the Service. Accounts that send Spam or that we believe may be facilitating Spam may be suspended or terminated at the sole discretion of Holler. Holler may participate in the prosecution of Spammers.</p>

<h3 id="prior-express-written-consent-opt-out-mechanism">2. Prior Express Written Consent; Opt-out Mechanism</h3>
<p>You will not initiate a voice call or communication, send, cause to be sent or facilitate the sending of any message or mobile communications using the Service if the intended recipient has not given You “Prior Express Written Consent”, which is a written agreement signed by the intended recipient that authorizes You to deliver marketing messages using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded message to the specific number authorized in the agreement.  A marketing message or call recipient’s signature may be evidenced by any electronic or digital form of signature recognized under applicable state or federal law, including any signatures that satisfy the E-SIGN Act.  You will keep copies of all written consent agreements for a period of at least four years from the last date that the consent was relied upon to initiate a call.
You must receive Prior Express Written Consent from each intended recipient, irrespective of the fact that you may have had a previous business relationship with the intended recipient.   Under no circumstances will You make a voice call, send Spam, or any other message where You obtained the consent of the recipient as a condition to a purchase.</p>

<p>You will include an automated interactive (voice or keypress) opt-out mechanism, announced or displayed at the beginning of the message and remaining available for activation during the entire message, that will immediately allow customers or potential customers to opt-out of receiving additional calls from You. You will automatically add the customer’s or potential customer’s number to Your do-not-call list and immediately disconnect the call when the opt-out mechanism is activated.</p>

<h3 id="limited-license">3. Limited License</h3>
<p>Holler grants You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services for Your own individual, enterprise, and limited commercial use subject to the other terms of this Agreement. You agree not to resell the Services. You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Services.

<h3 id="pricing-charges-billing-and-usage">5. Pricing, Charges, Billing and Usage</h3>
<p>Holler will never charge You to use its Services unless You sign up for a monthly or annual subscription to use the Services (any subscription, monthly or annual, is referred to herein as “Subscription”), which requires You to affirmatively select a Subscription and purchase that Subscription by entering Your credit card information. You authorize Holler to charge and/or place a hold on Your credit card with respect to any unpaid charges related to Your use of the Subscription . You authorize the issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and You agree that Your acceptance of this Agreement is authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay all such amounts. You authorize Holler and/or any other company who bills products or services, or acts as billing agent for Holler to continue to attempt to charge and/or place holds with respect to all sums described herein, or any portion thereof, to Your credit card until such amounts are paid in full. You authorize Holler and/or any other company who bills products or services, or acts as billing agent for Holler to bill You on either (i) a recurring monthly basis on the monthly anniversary of Your initial registration for a monthly Subscription or (ii) the annual anniversary of Your initial registration for an annual Subscription.</p>

<p>You authorize Holler and/or any other company who bills products or services, or acts as billing agent for Holler to bill You in a manner consistent with Your Subscription, starting on the date that You first register for a Subscription (the “Initial Subscription Date”).  All monthly Subscriptions will be billed on a recurring monthly basis on the monthly anniversary of Your Initial Subscription Date.  All annual Subscriptions will be billed on a recurring annual basis on the annual anniversary of Your Initial Subscription Date.  Should You later decide to purchase additional Subscriptions, You will be billed the amount in full on the day that the additional purchase occurs (the “Additional Purchase Date”), after which, if a recurring purchase, the additional purchase will be billed on Your same Initial Subscription Date anniversary, consistent in the manner as described above.</p>

<p>All Subscriptions will automatically renew for successive terms of the same previous duration, requiring no additional action on Your behalf.  Holler is not required to provide You notice of the automatic renewal.  Should You desire to end the automatic renewal of Your Subscription, You must provide written notice to support@holler.com detailing Your request to terminate (the “Termination Request”).

<p>B) Airtime Billing</p>

<p>AIRTIME AND OTHER MEASURED USAGE (“CHARGEABLE TIME”) IS BILLED IN FULL-MINUTE INCREMENTS, AND ACTUAL AIRTIME AND USAGE ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE NEXT FULL-MINUTE INCREMENT AT THE END OF EACH CALL FOR BILLING PURPOSES. WE CHARGE A FULL MINUTE OF AIRTIME USAGE FOR EVERY FRACTION OF THE LAST MINUTE OF AIRTIME USED ON EACH WIRELESS CALL. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, MINUTES WILL BE DEPLETED ACCORDING TO USAGE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: Chargeable Time begins for outgoing calls either (i) when You place an outgoing call over VoIP or Your wireless plan’s data connection or (ii) when You answer the incoming Holler call to Your personal phone number. Chargeable Time begins for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is established with our facilities. Chargeable Time ends after the call has ended, either by You, the person You are speaking with, or due to a technical malfunction, but not until Your signal of call disconnect is received by us and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.</p>

<p>All outgoing calls for which we receive answer supervision or which have at least 30 seconds of Chargeable Time, including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one minute airtime charge. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered; however, answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Chargeable Time may include time for us to recognize that only one party has disconnected from the call, time to clear the channels in use, and ring time. Chargeable Time may also occur from other uses of our facilities, including by way of example, voicemail deposits and retrievals, and call transfers. Calls that begin in one rate period and end in another rate period may be billed in their entirety at the rates for the period in which the call began.</p>

<p>If You select a Subscription to the Services that includes a predetermined allotment of Services (for example, a predetermined amount of airtime or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such Subscription, any unused allotment of Services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle. We may bill You in a format as we determine from time to time. Additional charges may apply for additional copies of Your bill, or for detailed information about Your usage of Services.</p>

<p>You also remain responsible for paying Your monthly Service fee if Your Service is suspended for nonpayment.</p>

<p>You agree that for amounts not paid by the due date, we may charge, as a part of its rates and charges, and You agree to pay, a late payment fee of 10% or the maximum allowed by law. In the event You fail to pay billed charges when due and it becomes necessary for us to refer Your account(s) to a third party for collection, we will charge a collection fee at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18% to cover our internal collection-related costs.</p>

<p>No charges to Your personal voice plan (cellular or otherwise) will be incurred when using the Services unless (1) You use Your personal phone to text to the Holler number to disseminate an SMS/MMS message to a group; (2) a person messages Your Holler number and You have enabled the SMS/MMS forwarding option in the account settings page; (3) You send a SMS/MMS message using Services to Your cellular phone; (4) You use the Services to bridge off of Your cellular plan to make voice calls, in which case Your carrier’s standard voice charges will apply; or (5) use Your wireless plan’s data connection in order to use the Services. In each of the mentioned cases, normal data and messaging rates may apply.</p>

<p>Recipients of SMS/MMS messages You sent and voice calls You made using the Services will be charged in accordance with the voice, data and messaging rates established by the recipient’s carriers.</p>

<p>C) Fair Use Policy</p>

<p>You are aware of the Holler Fair Use Policy (“FUP”), which grants Holler the ability to restrict the amount of messages, minutes and groups that can be sent or received per Subscription, per month or per annum.  The FUP is intended to prevent fraud and abuse of the services provided by Holler, by preventing practices on Your behalf included, but not limited to (i) sharing subscriptions between individuals or entities; (ii) behavior inconsistent with normal subscription use; (iii) subscriptions used for telemarketing or call center operations; and (iv) use of the services beyond the reasonably considered threshold.</p>

<p>If You have chosen to use Twilio as your SMS messaging provider, all messages are inherently restricted by Twilio and not by Holler. However, we reserve the right to restrict the volume of messages sent by any account at any time as we feel necessary.</p>

<h3 id="portability-and-reclaiming-numbers">6. Portability and Reclaiming Numbers</h3>

<p>If You are transferring an existing phone number to be Your Holler Phone Number for the Service (i.e., porting a number to us), You hereby authorize us or our agents to process Your order for our voice service and to notify Your existing provider of Your decision to switch Your services to Our service, and You represent that You are authorized to take this action. Not all telephone numbers are eligible for porting to us. Holler will charge, and You agree to pay, a ten-dollar ($10) fee to export Your Holler number to another service.</p>

<p>If Your Holler account remains inactive for thirty (30) days or more, we have the right to deactivate Your account and reclaim the Holler Phone Number that was assigned to You when You signed up to use the Services. If you are using your existing Twilio account with Holler, we will not reclaim the number, however we do have the ability to disable the number and reserve the right to do so.</p>
